In this final project, we design a program to help and encourage people who need to lose weight. This program will test whether users need to lose weight or not based on their BMI. For users who have high BMI value, the program will recommend the appropriate diet plan to them, based on their own choice from “classic/protein/fat/convenient/natural diet or sports.” Furthermore, if users would like to choose “protein,” the program will tell them how much protein they should take in order to lose weight. On the other hand, if users would like to choose “sports,” the program will tell them how many calories the sport they choose will take. For those whose BMI are low or normal, the program will recommend them to keep on their life styles.
